This repository contains scripts used for data extraction, processing, and analysis related to my [Marc Rebillet's Tier List project](https://0ctgn.cc/en/marc-tierlist). The main functionalities include:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from `XLS` tables and convert it into `JSON` format with `do_database.py`.
2. **Data Analysis and Plotting**: Perform a short statistical analysis and generate plots to visualize the data with `do_plots.py`. The results can be seen [here](https://0ctgn.cc/en/marc-stats).
3. **Song Downloading**: Download locally all the songs from the database with `dl_songs.py`.
